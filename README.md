Hello everyone, I’m @GermanFCG a Computer Systems Engineer that as been working mostly on Qality Assurance roles, 
I have knowledge in various topics related to product lifecycle, management, scrum, agile, you know the usual
stuff, I'm quite good worker in general for these areas, but as we are in a ever evolving industry I have to learn
and improve on the development skills I left aside when I shifted to QA, I want to improve on it so I can contribute
to many other aspects of a project, like automation and why not, maybe someday development of services, for products
or aplications, I'm trying to catch up to many other people but I feel confident that over time I will get to be quite
good at coding (at high school I used to be one of the best) so it's a matte rof practice and time.

I love videogames in all their aspects, honestly is one of the passions in my life and all the stories you can 
experience while playing is something truly amazing for me, I love talking about them and sharing experiences with 
other people, also I'm an amateur runner, already ran three half marathons with the dream of achieving a full marathon 
someday, Marvel/DC fanboy and many other geek stuff (surprise, suprise right?)
 
Been learning on Python, will follow up on Swift/Javascript and also working on system design topics, been taking some 
mock up interviews and reading a lot of documentation, it's been quite a good experience so far and I feel is something
incredible to work at due to the complexity a system can become and how to efficiently deliver the best experience to 
the users with the less (or better suited) resources.

I feel that currently my dream job would be something that would focus on the delivery of a product targeted to daily
customer use, like phones, game consoles, computers, IoT appliances, tablets and stuff that is delivered to make life
of people easier, happier and better, it would be incredible that someday I can go to a friend house and see them
using the product I helped to deliver and that it provides a great experience for them.
 
I'm really easygoing, joke a lot and relaxed guy that really believes life can be beatufiul, doing the right things.
Well that's a bit of me, hope is something good to share.
